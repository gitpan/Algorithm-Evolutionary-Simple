Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple - A few auxiliary functions to run a simple EA in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assorted functions needed by an evolutionary algorithm app; just to
    get started. 


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 random_chromosome( $length )

Creates a binary chromosome, with uniform distribution of 0s and 1s,
and returns it as a string.

=head2 max_ones( $string )

Classical function that returns the number of ones in a binary string.

=head2 spin($wheel, $slots )

Mainly for internal use, $wheel has the normalized probability, and
    $slots  the number of individuals to return.

=head2 single_generation( $population_arrayref, $fitness_of_hashref )

Applies all steps to arrive to a new generation, except
evaluation. Keeps the two best for the next generation.

=head2 get_pool_roulette_wheel( $population_arrayref, $fitness_of_hashref, $how_many_I_need )

Obtains a pool of new chromosomes using fitness_proportional selection

=head2 produce_offspring( $population_hashref, $how_many_I_need )

Uses mutation first and then crossover to obtain a new population

=head2 mutate( $string )

Bitflips a  a single point in the binary string

=head2 crossover( $one_string, $another_string )

Applies two-point crossover to both strings, returning them changed

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Will complain if some argument is missing.


Algorithm::Evolutionary::Simple requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Sort::Key::Top> for efficient sorting. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are excellent evolutionary algorithm libraries out there; see
    for instance L<AI::Genetic::Pro>

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

It's intended for simplicity, not flexibility. If you want a
    full-featured evolutionary algorithm library, check L<Algorithm::Evolutionary>

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-algorithm-evolutionary-simple@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
